export const html = `<h2>This final draft editor is pretty cool!</h2>\n
<p>It is built with plugins from the awesome draft-js-plugins project. 🐲☀️🗻</p>\n
<p><br></p>\n<p>It is nice to see the color changes if we go over our limit, 300 characters and also 50 words</p>\n
<p><br></p>\n<p>Pretty #cool to see #hastags :)</p>\n
<p><br></p>\n<p>Also nice is the inline toolbar to show options <ins>once</ins> you select <em>part</em> of the <strong>text</strong></p>\n
<p><br></p>\n<p>And the side toolbar to the left ⬅️</p>\n
<p><br></p>\n<p>Of course links to cool sites like https://draft-js-plugins.com work too</p>\n
<p><br></p>\n<p>Mentions are a nice feature, just @ someone...</p>\n<p><br></p>
