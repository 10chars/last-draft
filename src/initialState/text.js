export const text = `This final draft editor is pretty cool!
It is built with plugins from the awesome draft-js-plugins project. 🐲☀️🗻

It is nice to see the color changes if we go over our limit, 300 characters and also 50 words

Pretty #cool to see #hastags :)

Also nice is the inline toolbar to show options once you select part of the text

And the side toolbar to the left ⬅️

Of course links to cool sites like https://draft-js-plugins.com work too

Mentions are a nice feature, just @ someone...
