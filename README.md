final-draft is a Draft.js editor built using [draft-js-plugins](https://draft-js-plugins.com)

## Run

**Note:** Currently including the draft-js-plugins in this project as I work on them, once they are stable and version 2 is released, they will go back to being includes. So to run this at the moment, you will need to yarn install in each plugin subfolder for now.

```
yarn install
npm run dev
open http://127.0.0.1:3000
```
